Cybersecurity is (or should be!) one of the biggest concerns for every business. Our cloud software protects against unauthorised access and enables you to easily limit access to files and folders on a ‘need to know’ basis.

The security stands up to cyber threats and doesn’t rely on your staff to review and update security protocols. This includes much higher change of data recovery should you loose data, when compared with on premise systems.
