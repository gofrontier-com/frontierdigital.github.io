## We’re Better. Here’s Why…

We were born out of the realisation that companies moving to the Cloud had often found their pathway blocked, or were spending more than they expected trying to navigate the system. We want to use our experience to change the way software is developed; your developers should play a key role in your organisation’s journey to achieve your vision and break new ground.

Our goal is that every employee can use the software in a way that makes their job easier and more efficient. We can help you use the whole system, ensuring you are getting the very best value from your chosen Cloud product.

Frontier Digital is your partner for DevOps, Sys Admin and Cloud. (Link to blog 2) Working together we build secure, scalable and highly available environments and automate repetitive tasks. While creating quality systems is an important part of our job, the most important, is coaching your team to use these systems. The most sophisticated technology in the world, is only a success if the end user understands how to make the most of it.

We are a team of Cloud software enthusiasts who have come together to do things a little differently, to disrupt the largely inaccessible software world, ensuring that no one in your team is left behind. We are an approachable bunch, so even if you aren’t totally sure you are ready for our help yet, we would love to have a chat with you and steer you in the right direction.
