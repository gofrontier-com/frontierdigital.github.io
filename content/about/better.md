## We’re better. Here’s why...

> *"We were born out of the realisation that companies moving to
the cloud often find their pathway blocked, or spend more time
than they expect trying to navigate the system. We want to use
our experience to change the way cloud platform is approached,
developed and operated."*

Craig Anderson, CEO


> *"At Frontier we are not afraid to tackle problems head on. We
take time to understand the problem you want to solve and use our
experience to engineer a solution with you. We believe in using
the right tool for the job, whether 'off the shelf' or bespoke,
but you won't find us bringing solutions for problems you don't
have."*

Fraser Davidson, CTO
