# Why Frontier Digital?

It’s time for your business to get onto the Cloud, but how do you ensure you implement it correctly? Or perhaps you are already on the Cloud, but your platform isn’t working for you as well as you had hoped?

When it comes to Cloud systems, there is no one-size-fits-all. Our experienced team can work with yours to ensure you get exactly what you need. We will review your usage and requirements so that everything you pay for, you use, providing you with the very best value.

## Functional and Scalable Cloud Platforms

Your cloud system will be fully scalable, meaning that we can develop functionality as you develop new services, expand to new locations and take on more staff. Our team will be with you all the way to help you navigate new processes and to train your team to use your cloud platform to its full potential.

One of the best ways to manage this is by moving to Kubernetes – this ensures that any scaling of your software happens smoothly, harmoniously and with limited downtime. We have lots of experience in supporting businesses to grow and expand.

We will remotely maintain your software, meaning less need for in-house and on-premise IT specialists, reducing IT maintenance costs significantly. We guarantee a low MTTR so that if any issues do arise, you are back in action fast. However, due to the high level of redundancy built into the architecture, you won’t even notice the vast majority of failures in the system.

## But why choose Frontier Digital?

Our goal is to work with businesses in the early stages of development who, like us, want to do things a little differently. We see many of our clients as young, growing businesses who understand the value a high-quality, bespoke cloud system can bring to their work – businesses who are as excited and motivated to grow with the support of powerful technology.

We work with clients from a range of sectors. For us, it’s not about what you dobut how you think. A high volume and turnover of clients will never be our model. We want to build long-term relationships and focus on full coaching and implementation.

Our software is carefully tailored to the needs of each client, and we provide real value by designing software that is both flexible and accessible.

## Cloud Software for Everyone

Finally, we are approachable. There are certain stereotypes about ‘techie’ people – the ‘have you tried turning it on and off again’ rhetoric. Being judgmental towards clients, or even someone just asking for a bit of advice, gets you nowhere. We want to see a world where everyone has access to great technology and where gatekeepers are replaced with mentors.

So, if you are looking for a system that works in harmony with your day-to-day tasks, which is used fully by every employee and for which you have ongoing dedicated support, then Frontier Digital are the DevOps team for you.
