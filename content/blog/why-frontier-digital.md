# Why Frontier Digital?

It’s time for your business to move to the Cloud, but how do you ensure you get there safely, securely and without it running away with the pennies? Or perhaps you are already have a platform, but it isn’t working for you as well as you had hoped?

When it comes to Cloud platforms, there is no one-size-fits-all. Our experienced team can work with yours to build an automated, secure, observable and cost-effective cloud platform that's fit for your needs.

## The right tool for the job

Modern application development teams build applications using a variety of ecosystems, depending on the problem they're trying to solve. We're no different. We believe in using the right tool for the job, whether open source, ‘off the shelf’ or bespoke.

We are not afraid to tackle problems head on. We take time to understand the problem you want to solve and use our experience to engineer a solution with you. You won’t find us trying to sell you a solution for a problem you don’t have.

We think the best way to effect technology change is by delivering incremental value following agile methodologies, with short feedback loops and a focus on continuous improvement. This is how we work, and we can help you to work that way too, if you want.

## But why choose Frontier Digital?

Our goal is to work with businesses at all stages of development who, like us, want to get the best from Cloud.

We see our clients as a mix of young, growing businesses who anticipate the value a well-engineered Cloud platform can add, and more established businesses who have taken the leap to the Cloud already but want to step it up a gear, or go back and spend some time on the foundations. They all have something in common: They are as excited and motivated to grow with the support of powerful technology as we are.

We work with clients from a range of sectors. For us, it’s not about what you do but how you do it. A high volume and turnover of clients will never be our model. We want to build long-term relationships and focus on helping your Cloud platform grow in maturity as your business grows in strength.

## Cloud for everyone

Finally, we are approachable. There are certain stereotypes about ‘techie’ people – the ‘have you tried turning it on and off again’ rhetoric. Being judgmental towards clients, or even someone just asking for a bit of advice, gets you nowhere. We want to see a world where everyone has access to great technology and where gatekeepers are replaced with mentors.

So, if you are looking for a partner to help you start something epic, or build better, then Frontier Digital can help.
