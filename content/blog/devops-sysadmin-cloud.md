# DevOps, Sys Admin, the Cloud – Explained

We use a lot of technical terminologies in our work, and while many of our clients are in the know, not every business is. We also want everyone in your organisation to understand who we are and what we do so that we can communicate with everyone instead of just your CTO or IT Manager.

## Cloud vs On-Premise Software

Cloud technology is the future. It saves time and energy and makes almost every business process faster and easier. Your cloud software can grow with your business; you can add new capabilities as your team becomes larger, more specialised and your needs change. This means that your business can also learn how to use cloud software at a pace that suits your expertise.

When information systems are based within your premises (e.g. a server in our office), you must implement both physical (security staff/cameras) and traditional IT security methods. Managing and updating these security systems can be costly and time-consuming, and they aren’t as effective as the protection offered by our cloud software.

Cloud software moves your information ‘hub’ to a remote location. For instance, if you are using Microsoft Azure, your information and systems are stored on a Microsoft server.

Cloud security stands up better to cyber threats and doesn’t rely on your staff to review and update security protocols. This includes a much higher chance of data recovery should you lose data compared with on-premise systems.

## What about DevOps?

DevOps is a method of working. Traditional software development companies were split into two teams - Development and Operations. The Development team would develop a piece of software and send it to the Operations team for testing. They’d test it, give feedback on bugs, and that process would start again until they eventually reached a final product.

DevOps, on the other hand, is the bright idea to merge these two teams to create a more efficient software process, breaking down the communication barrier between these two business functions. What that means, in practice, is that DevOps organisations like Frontier Digital get things done faster and create high-quality, intuitive products that work.

## Sys Admin

Sys Admin or SysAdmin is short for Systems Administrator, who looks after the upkeep, performance, and operation of multi-user computer systems. Some organisations have an in-house Sys Admin, but this is something we provide for you. Large organisations may even have many, such as a separate Database Administrator, Web Administrator or Site Reliability Engineer.

Hopefully, this has helped you get to grips with all the terms! If there is anything you still aren’t sure of, just ask us! Frontier Digital are here to educate, inform and increase access, never to judge.
