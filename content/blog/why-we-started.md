# Why we started

What happens when four software engineers realise they share the same vision? A vision that turns traditional DevOps on its head, that sees a future where Cloud platforms are created in a bespoke way that merges flawlessly with the strategy of individual organisations. Where implementation is followed by training and guidance for as long as an organisation requires it. Where end users, no matter their experience with the technology, can get the system to really work for them.

Those four engineers launched a boutique Cloud Platform and DevOps professional services company called Frontier Digital.

The biggest motivator for Frontier’s four founders was embarking on an adventure with a group of software engineers who really ‘get’ each other and have a real passion for what they do and for helping other businesses thrive. We are all keen to develop systems which simultaneously make organisations more efficient and successful while improving accessibility.

Supporting and mentoring those at the early stages of their career is also important to Frontier Digital, and we are excited to grow our own team and help launch some brilliant software engineers into the sector.

## Craig

“Over the past few months, I have developed closer working relationships with individuals whose work I have admired for a while now. Having a capable team around me who think alike, and know how to deliver, gives me full confidence in the future of our business. I am also excited at the prospect of growing our team and supporting those at the beginning of their career to really thrive within the industry.

For me, there is nothing more rewarding than building something that makes people’s working life easier, more efficient and more profitable. I look forward to the days when at the end of a project and I can step back and say, “we did that” – it’s what I live for!”

## Fraser

“Every now and then, I get to work with someone who approaches things with the same mindset. Who understands why I work the way I do and why it is so important that I get things right every time, first time.

I’ve known since I was a teenager that I wanted to do ‘something with computers’, but it has taken me a while to figure out what…. When I started out in my career, running my own business definitely wasn’t part of the plan, but I guess if you want something done right, you’ve got to do it yourself! Well, yourself plus a group of brilliant colleagues.”

## Neil

“My goal for Frontier Digital is to build software that is so good our clients almost take it for granted. Clean, efficient and elegant solutions which are tailored to the companies we work with. Cloud-based systems should be an integral part of every medium to large organisation, but they have to be created in a way that actually works for those companies.

I have a huge amount of trust in the abilities of our team, and I know the quality of work we will produce will be of a very high standard. Being able to work with a group of people who genuinely love and care about the software they create is going to be a fantastic experience. We really ‘get’ each other, and I’m already very proud to be a part of Frontier Digital.”

## Anthony

“At this point in my career, my focus is to work with good people who understand where I’m coming from and who are ready to take on anything. I have a brilliant team of like-minded colleagues and being able to bounce ideas around a group of such switched-on, talented people has been a lot of fun.

I am passionate about mentoring junior team members. So, I am pleased that Frontier Digital feels strongly about taking on those who are near the start of their career and supporting them to develop and thrive.”
