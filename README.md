Frontier Digital Website
========================

# Overview

The website is created using [hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Consult the hugo documentation for getting started with development.

A merge to the `main` branch will build the site and deploy to the `gh-pages` branch which is used by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This process is handled by a GitHub actions workflow.

The site uses [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) as a css framework and the [Exo 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2) font. The assets are pulled directly from cdn for simplicity for now.

# Development

## Local

1. Run `brew install hugo` to install Hugo.
